    <h1>Chicken Birynai</h1>
    <p>
      A fragrant and flavorful South Asian rice dish made with tender chicken
      pieces marinated in aromatic spices, layered with basmati rice, and
      slow-cooked to perfection. Each bite bursts with rich flavors of saffron,
      caramelized onions, fresh herbs, and a blend of traditional biryani
      masala. Served hot with raita or salad, this dish is a true comfort
      classic
