    <h1>Bihari Boti</h1>
    <p>
      Our Bihari Boti is a traditional BBQ favorite made from tender chunks of
      beef marinated in a rich blend of yogurt, raw papaya, mustard oil, and
      signature Bihari spices. Grilled over charcoal to achieve a perfect smoky
      aroma, each piece is juicy, flavorful, and melts in your mouth. A true
      taste of authentic Pakistani street-style barbecue with bold, rustic
      flavors in every bite.
