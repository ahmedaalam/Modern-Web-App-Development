    <h1>Bihari Tikka</h1>
    <p>
      Our Bihari Tikka is inspired by the famous flavors of Bihar, Pakistan.
      Thin strips of marinated beef are infused with a mix of mustard oil, raw
      papaya, and a secret blend of spices, then grilled on skewers to
      perfection. The result â€” soft, smoky, and irresistibly flavorful tikka
      that melts in your mouth.
