    <h1>Beef Biryani</h1>
    <p>
      A hearty and aromatic rice dish made with tender, slow-cooked beef layered
      with fragrant basmati rice, caramelized onions, and a blend of traditional
      spices. Each serving is rich in flavor, perfectly spiced, and cooked to
      perfection â€” a true celebration of South Asian cuisine.
